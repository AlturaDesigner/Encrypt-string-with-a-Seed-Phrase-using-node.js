# Encrypt-string-with-a-Seed-Phrase-using-python

This is a Python script that encrypts a word using a seed phrase. The script uses the cryptography library to generate a key from the seed phrase and then uses that key to encrypt the word using the Fernet encryption method. The encrypted word is then returned by the encrypt_word function.
